### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/MilkaLichtblau/FA-IR_Ranking.git`

2. In a command-line shell, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:
`$ cd ~/Downloads/FA-IR_Ranking/src`

## Datasets

The following datasets are included:

| Code  | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| sat   | *Scholastic Assessment Test* ([SAT](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/sat/sat-percentile-ranks-composite-crit-reading-math-writing-2014.pdf)): a standardized test used in the US for university admissions  |
| compas | *Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions* ([COMPAS](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis)): a survey used in some US states for alternative sanctions such as parole |
| germancredit | [German Credit Scores](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)) (SCHUFA) dataset |
| xing | A dataset collected from the professional social network Xing in Jan/Feb 2017 |

The datasets are included in the repository in "raw" form, so you need to use the `-c` option first to create the processed datasets, as described below.

## Reproducing the experiments in the paper

`python3 main.py -h` can be used to obtain help.

`python3 main.py -c dataset` creates datasets. The *dataset* can be "sat," "compas," "germancredit," or "xing." If you omit the dataset, it will create all datasets.

`python3 main.py -r dataset-attribute` ranks a dataset using the FA\*IR algorithm and a baseline algorithm, with respect to a protected attribute. If you omit the *dataset-attribute* it ranks all.

* `python3 main.py -r sat` ranks the *sat* dataset with protected attribute gender=female.
* `python3 main.py -r compasgender` ranks the *compas* dataset with protected attribute gender=male
* `python3 main.py -r compasrace` ranks the *compas* dataset with protected attribute race=black
* `python3 main.py -r germancredit_25` ranks the *germancredit* dataset with protected attribute age=below 25
* `python3 main.py -r germancredit_35` ranks the *germancredit* dataset with protected attribute age=below 35
* `python3 main.py -r germancredit_gender` ranks the *germancredit* dataset with protected attribute gender=female
* `python3 main.py -r xing` ranks the *xing* dataset with protected attribute gender=female

`python3 main.py -e dataset-attribute` evaluates a set of rankings generated using the method above.
